===================================

[09/01/2014~12/15/2014] 

The goal of this project is to classify the gene expression data of leukemia patients into its subtypes, using multiple feature elimination algorithms and classification algorithms. 

Please see multinomial_classification_of_leukemia_subtypes.pdf for more detailed description of this project.
